What I did instead of sorting the file from the original csv file, was to make 2 seperate dataframes which one was stored into a csv file later on from the original csv file that found the average make, and model pricing. The other dataframe was only used for graphs and comparison. I then put these dataframes into matplotlib and have suitable graphs for the GUI.\n",

    "- What do I do next: As I finished Data Analysis, Visualisation and Reporting, the next step was creating a GUI for the user to access. An addon to this GUI is a help system, which easily gives car preferences based on the dataframes I created today. For example, if I asked for a car of an engine size of 4.2 L and a price below 40000, it would give me my preference. If I didn't care about other aspects such as model, I would leave it blank."
