    "- Adjustments/Changes: Here was the finished GUI, using reused code from Documentation 2 as shown, and using Tkinter to visualise the GUI. This mainly used notebook widgets, which I found a tutorial from here: https://www.pythontutorial.net/tkinter/tkinter-notebook/. This required me to import ttk from Tkinter. Then, to intialise matplotlib into tkinter, I used the 3rd line shown, found from this website: https://pythonprogramming.net/how-to-embed-matplotlib-graph-tkinter-gui/. The rest of the coding was done through the original link given to make buttons: https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-buttons-in-tkinter/, and the original code from documentation 2. \n",

    "- Did it Work: This ultimately worked after 2 days, one of the reasons why this would not work was because of forgetting to pack the matplotlib into the frame and not knowing to which was ultimately the hardest part for me in making a GUI putting matplotlib inside, especially this line was hard to understand: fig, ax = plt.subplots() and  canvas = FigureCanvasTkAgg(fig, master=modelframe) canvas.draw() canvas.get_tk_widget().pack(side=tk.TOP, fill=tk.BOTH, expand=1). But after the tutorial it helped much more. Another basic reason was because of bad indenting, and so on and so forth.\n",

    "- What do I do next: As I finished the GUI, a suggestion would be to add loops to make it much more clear and concise, as there is a lot of redundancy and repetition in the code. But overall, this would be my final product and a success of using Tkinter and making a functioning GUI."
